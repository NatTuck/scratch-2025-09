## Midterm Reports

- People said stuff.

## Application Performance

- Need faster operations

Two things to measure:

- Response time for user interaction
  - Initial response time
  - Complete whole interaction response time
  - Measure: Time in milliseconds
- Non-interactive batch processing
  - Measure: Throughput in number of things done per hour

## Web App Response Time

What's fast?

- 15 ms is getting in the range of 1-2 render frames for a video game
- Less than 50 ms is great
- Less than 500ms is okay
- Over a second is kind of bad
- 10 seconds is unusable

Three buckets:

- HTTP request, response
- Websocket request, response
- Some sort of fully local operation (pure JavaScript, typically)

### Timing for HTTP request / response

Here's what we need to do

(Assume client in NH, server in CA; RTT >= 30ms)

- DNS lookup (UDP)
  - 1 RTT
- Handshake (TCP)
  - 1 RTT
- Need to do the request and response (no way to avoid this one)
  - 1 RTT
- Server Processing
  - This is where our code runs
  - DB query
  - Processing time
  - Shouldn't be significantly slower than network time

More TCP problems:

- Slow start
