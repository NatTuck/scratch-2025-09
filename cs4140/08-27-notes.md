## Agile Software Project Management

Agile is definitely a buzzword, and it's main purpose is to sell
consulting services to managers, especially in 2025.

"In the bad old days, there was waterfall..."

Waterfall goes in a fixed sequence:

 - Collect requirements
 - Then you have archetects do a design on paper
 - Finished design goes to the development ("construction") team.
 - Deliver it to the customer

Pretty consistently:

 - The customer can't use it, and so you loop back to the beginning to
   do a revison.

Agile development:

 - Simplest expression: Do that whole cycle in a week.
 - Another key idea: The customer needs to look at the partially
   completed project and give feedback. Not just once or twice,
   but constantly.

Problems:

 - Nobody knows the requirements.
 - They'll change during the project.
 - You'll discover stuff during development.

## "Agile"

### The Agile Manifesto

Software projects should value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.


### Kanban

A kanban board is a board on the wall you can put sticky notes on.

Each task gets put on the board, and as it progresses through different
stages, you move the sticky note.

This lets everyone see how progress is being made on tasks.

This visibility allows not just task management, but also enables
process improvement.

"Continuous Improvement"

## Scrum

Adding back in the processes and tools.
