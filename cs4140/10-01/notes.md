## Improving Code Quality

### The Problem

- We have more than one developer.
- We have more than three developers.
- This reduces code quality:
  - e.g. One big file, stuff in the wrong place,
    redundant code, no tests, etc.
- We've also seen features being developed and then
  breaking from other code changes.


### Two kinds of thing we can do

- Code reviews
  - A (second) human looks at code changes to try to avoid
    bad code / bad changes.
  - What to look for? Checklist.
- Automated checks
  - We have one: Does the test suite pass?
  - We can add more.
