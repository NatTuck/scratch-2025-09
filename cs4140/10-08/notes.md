# Can we download and use other people's code?

Copyright:

- If you use other people's software, by default, they can sue you and take all
your stuff.
- Getting sued won't always happen to an individual, usually will happen to a
profitable business.
- The person (or company) who wrote the software can offer a copyright license
which allows copying / redistribution / use.

## Kinds of Copyright License

- Open Source (sometimes called "Free Software")
  - Freely usable and redistributable in source and binary form.
  - Have available source code.
  - Allow people to create and distribute modified versions.
  - Not impose certain odius requirements.

- Permissive open source license
  - Most common for programming libraries.
  - Basically no restrictions, except frequently a requirement
    to give credit to the author (or at least not remove
    credit).
  - Probably the Patent clause in the Apache-2.0 license is
    an example of the largest unexpected term you're likely to find.
  - Examples: Apache-2.0

- Copyleft open source licenses
  - One extra rule: Any derivative works must maintain
    the same license and always be distributed with
    complete source code.
  - Absolutely a political statement
  - Also, a business model. Some users may prefer paid
    commercial licenses.
  - Example licenses: GNU GPL (v2, v3), MPL, SCSL
    - GPLv2: MySQL, Linux Kernel
    - GPLv3: GNU Project stuff (e.g. gcc)
  - Apple hates GPLv3 with a fiery passion.

- Zero Cost Proprietary Licenses
  - No fees, no source code

- Paid Commercial Licenses
  - If you don't pay, you can't use the software.
  - Generally have specific terms to make sure you pay
    more as you get bigger.

Summary: 

- Permissive open source is great.
- Anything else requires careful business analysis.
- Payware is a trap.
