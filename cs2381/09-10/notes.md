## Lists

Attendance: 51FE8B

Three ways we've seen to make a sequence of items in Java:

- Array - not really lists, can't resize.
- Last class, we used List.of(...)
  - Examined more carefully, this can't resize either. It also
    doesn't let us change the items in the list.
- Singly linked list (`Cell`) 

It turns out that there are a bunch of ways to make a list.

In Java, `List` isn't a type, it's an interface.

Operations:

 - add
 - get
 - set
 - size
 - iterator, lets for-each loops work
