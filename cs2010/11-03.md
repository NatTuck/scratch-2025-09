Levels of Abstraction

- High level: We're going to find and cut down trees
- Low level: Move forward

What goes in the middle?

Plan: Take the high level task and break it down into
pieces.

"Search an area for trees and cut them down."

- Search area for trees.

"Search for one tree"

- Follow some pattern that covers the area.
  - Forward and back, alternating columns.
  - Spiral
  - Hilbert Curve
  - Any other pattern
- Stop when we run into a log.
  - That's a tree. Next, chop down the tree.

"Chop down the tree."

- Idea: Chop down a whole square column (3x3)
- Problem: Sometimes branches are outside of that
  range.
- Solution: Recenter column on log as we go up.
