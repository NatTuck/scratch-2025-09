# Git(hub) Collaboration

Q: Collaborate on what?

A: Anything that's mostly stored as plain text files.

## What is "plain text"?

Not plain text:

- Images, Videos, Audio, Entire applications compiled
  for distribution
- Anything encrypted or compressed
- "Rich" document formats like Microsoft Word

Plain text:

- Computer program source code (e.g. lua code, python, java, etc)
- Markdown, HTML, LaTeX for scientific (math & cs) papers, etc.

## Why "mostly plain text"?

- Git manages plain text revisions (small, partital changes) efficiently
  without storing every complete version separately.
- No such luck for non-text documents. All it can do is store every full
  different version.
- A couple small non-text files is fine.

## Typical collaboration workflow on Github

- Someone starts a project, makes a repository on Github.
- Each collaborator:
  - creates a personal fork on github
  - clones to local machine
  - creates a feature branch (local)
  - makes the changes in that branch (local)
  - creates a pull request (on github)
- Owner / manager of original repo reviews and merges PR
