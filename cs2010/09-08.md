From our truth table, we got:

  CA'B + CAB'


Undistribute C:

  C(A'B + AB')



You'll remember from regular algebra some algebraic laws.

ex: awx + ayz = a(wx + yz)


Laws of boolean algebra.

- Associativity of AND and OR:
  - abc = a(bc) = (ab)c
  - a+b+c = a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c
- Commutativity of AND and OR
  - ab = ba
  - a+b = b+a
- Identity, Annhiliation, Idempotence, Complementation:
  - 1a = a ; 0+b = b
  - 0a = 0 ; 1+b = 1
  - a+a = a ; aa = a
  - aa' = 0 ; a+a' = 1
- DeMorgan's Laws:
  - x'y' = (x + y)'
  - x'+y' = (xy)'
