- At a grocery store the policy is that when someone tries to buy beer the clerk
  checks their ID.
- Sell beer only if: The ID is valid and the customer is over 21.

- Alice tries to buy beer.
- Her ID is obviously fake.
- It shows her to be 23.

Formally:

- A = ID not fake                   False
- B = Age > 23                      True
- C = The moon is made of cheese    dunno

- Sell beer only if (A and B)

# Boolean Logic

A guy named George Boole formalized an algebra of propositional expressions
(now called Boolean Algebra)

Two values:           Bit value         Logic Level
- True                1                 +3.3V
- False               0                 +0V

Three operations:
- AND
- OR
- NOT

Truth tables.

**How to write boolean expressions**

# Usefullness to Us

- The math of bits and the math of propositional logic are the same.

**Regular Arithmetic in Binary**

```
  1 1 1
    0 1 1 0  = 6  = 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1
  + 1 0 1 1  = 11 = 1*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1  
  ---------
  1 0 0 0 1

```


**Addition with Logic**

```
  A
+ B
---
C S
```
